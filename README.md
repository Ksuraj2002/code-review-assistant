This project focuses on building a seamless system that uses a large language model (LLM) to analyze source code and provide immediate, actionable feedback.


Objective: To automate the analysis of code structure, readability, and adherence to best practices.

Core Functionality:


Input: User uploads a source code file  


Processing: A Node.js backend receives the file, extracts the content, and sends it to the Gemini LLM


Output: The LLM returns a detailed review report with improvement suggestions, which is then displayed to the user.
